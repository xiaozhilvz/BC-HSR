#BC-star_rail
Improved the way it works. 
I compiled this junk code for 6 hours

Construction method
Just open your compiler,and include the minhook,mihok,star_rail
I've made it easier to compile, if not, it's your problem
release i create it,it have inject in it
Then I can only advise you to give up
